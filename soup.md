#  Step by Step Instrustions to prepare Soup



#     Let’s Make Some Soup!
This slow cooker chicken tortellini soup is super easy to make. Simply add all of the ingredients to the slow cooker except for the tortellini. I like to add that in about 15 minutes before serving, so they don’t get mushy!
## Add Ingredients: Add all of the ingredients to a slow cooker except for the tortellini.
## Cook: Cook on low for 6 hours.
## Shred chicken: Remove the cooked chicken from the slow cooker and then shred (or cube) and add back to the slow cooker.
## Add Tortellini: With 15 minutes left then you can add the tortellini to the soup.
## Season: Season with salt and pepper to taste. Discard bay leaves and then serve immediately with chopped parsley, if desired.
